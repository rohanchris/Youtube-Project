Youtube Data Harvestinng and Warehousing
Project Title: YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit

Skills Demonstrated:

Python Scripting
Data Collection using Google YouTube Data API
Streamlit for Interactive Visualization
API Integration
Data Management with SQL (PostgreSQL and MongoDB)
Domain: Social Media Analytics

Project Description:

This project establishes a framework for harvesting and warehousing valuable YouTube channel data, empowering you to explore and analyze it effectively. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Data Collection with Google YouTube Data API:

Leverage the Google YouTube Data API to retrieve comprehensive data about YouTube channels, including channel details, videos, playlists, and comments.
Integrate the API seamlessly within your Python code using the official client library.
Data Warehousing with SQL:

Construct a robust data warehouse using two popular SQL database systems: PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
Design and implement well-structured tables for efficient storage of channel, video, playlist, and comment data.
Ensure data integrity by following relational database principles for PostgreSQL and utilizing appropriate schema design for MongoDB.
Choose PostgreSQL for its structured querying capabilities and advanced data analysis features, while MongoDB excels in handling semi-structured data like comments.
Data Analysis and Visualization with Streamlit:

Craft an interactive web application using Streamlit, a Python library that simplifies web framework development.
Formulate ten insightful queries to extract meaningful insights from the harvested YouTube data.
Employ Streamlit to render the query results within a user-friendly interface, enabling the visualization of answers directly within the application.
This interactive interface allows users to explore YouTube channel data, gain valuable insights into content performance and audience engagement, and potentially even formulate new research questions.
Repository Contents:

Python code for data harvesting using the YouTube Data API
SQL scripts for creating and populating tables in PostgreSQL and MongoDB
Streamlit code for building the interactive web application, including logic for fetching data from the database(s) and presenting the ten pre-defined queries and their results
Next Steps:

This project lays a solid foundation for further exploration of YouTube data.
Consider expanding the scope of data collection and analysis by incorporating additional YouTube API metrics and leveraging more sophisticated data analysis techniques.
Explore the possibilities of integrating with other data sources for a more holistic understanding of online video content and audience behavior.
Additional Considerations:

Provide clear instructions for setting up the project, including installation guidelines and API key management.
Employ effective commenting within the code to enhance readability and maintainability.
Consider modularizing your code for better organization and reusability.
By providing a comprehensive project description, well-structured code, and proper documentation, you'll create a valuable resource on GitHub for your audience and build upon your technical skills in data collection, warehousing, and visualization.
