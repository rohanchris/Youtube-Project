Youtube Data Harvestinng and Warehousing
This project empowers you to delve into the vast world of YouTube data by building a comprehensive data pipeline and interactive analysis dashboard. Here's what you'll gain:
Harness the Power of Python Scripting: Craft efficient Python scripts to harvest valuable YouTube channel, video, playlist, and comment data using the official YouTube Data API. Streamline Data Collection: Leverage Google API keys to seamlessly retrieve the desired information from YouTube. Master Streamlit: Create a user-friendly, interactive dashboard with Streamlit, allowing users to explore the harvested data with ease. Bridge the Data Gap (SQL & MongoDB): Effectively store and manage the collected data using your choice of either a structured SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or a flexible NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB). Uncover Insights: Craft 10 insightful queries to extract meaningful information from the YouTube data. Visualize these insights within the Streamlit dashboard for an intuitive grasp. Streamlined Workflow: The project integrates seamlessly, transferring results from Python scripts to your Streamlit dashboard for a smooth user experience. Key Skills Demonstrated:
Python Programming API Integration (YouTube Data API) Data Collection & Management (SQL &/or MongoDB) Streamlit for Interactive Data Exploration Target Audience:
Data enthusiasts curious about YouTube data Developers seeking to build data pipelines with Python and APIs Data analysts wanting to leverage Streamlit for visualizations Additional Considerations:
Clean Code: Ensure well-structured, documented, and maintainable code for easy understanding and future modifications. Flexibility: While the description mentions specific technologies, consider making it adaptable to other SQL/NoSQL databases or cloud platforms for broader appeal. Deployment: Briefly mention if the project includes instructions for deployment (e.g., containerization using Docker). User Experience: Emphasize the user-friendliness of the Streamlit dashboard and the potential for further customization.
